Credit risk analysis is the process of evaluating the potential risk that a borrower may default on a loan or credit agreement. This involves assessing the borrower's creditworthiness through various quantitative and qualitative factors, such as credit history, financial statements, market conditions, and economic indicators. The goal is to predict the likelihood of default and mitigate potential losses by making informed lending decisions, setting appropriate interest rates, and implementing effective risk management strategies.
