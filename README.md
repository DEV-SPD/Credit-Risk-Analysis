Credit risk analysis is the process of evaluating the potential risk that a borrower may default on a loan or credit agreement. This involves assessing the borrower's creditworthiness through various quantitative and qualitative factors, such as credit history, financial statements, market conditions, and economic indicators. The goal is to predict the likelihood of default and mitigate potential losses by making informed lending decisions, setting appropriate interest rates, and implementing effective risk management strategies.

# Why credit risk is so relevant in finance?
Financial institutions used credit risk analysis models to determine the probability of default of a potential borrower. 

The model provides information on the level of a borrowerâ€™s credit risk at any particular time. If the lender fails to detect the credit risk in advance, it exposes them to the risk of default and loss of funds. 

Lenders rely on the validation provided by credit risk analysis models to make key lending decisions on whether or not to extend credit to the borrower and the credit to be charged.

With the continuous evolution of technology, banks are continually researching and developing effective ways of modeling credit risk.
