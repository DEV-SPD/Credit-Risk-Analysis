# Credit Risk Modelling
Credit analysis is a type of financial analysis that an investor or bond portfolio manager performs on companies, governments, municipalities, or any other debt-issuing entities to measure the issuer's ability to meet its debt obligations. Credit analysis seeks to identify the appropriate level of default risk associated with investing in that particular entity's debt instruments.

To judge a company’s ability to pay its debt, banks, bond investors, and analysts conduct credit analysis on the company. Using financial ratios, cash flow analysis, trend analysis, and financial projections, an analyst can evaluate a firm’s ability to pay its obligations. A review of credit scores and any collateral is also used to calculate the creditworthiness of a business.

The outcome of the credit analysis will determine what risk rating to assign the debt issuer or borrower. The risk rating, in turn, determines whether to extend credit or loan money to the borrowing entity and, if so, the amount to lend.
